Fraud Detection Machine Learning Model

The goal of this project was to create a ML model with at least 70% recall. When working with E-Commerce Transactions, recall is vital.
The recall demonstrates the amount of fraudulent charges the model is finding.

While the recall is just above the goal, the precision is low. 
I would suggest further focus on improving the precision, so we can minimize the amount of false red flags for fraud.

I also found the top 10 factors that are related to fraud.
